summary: 
review: Even though the ingenuosity of the tricks behind this locked-room mystery is the main attraction of the novel, it left me rather skeptical. The setting, the characters and most importantly, young detective Kosuke Kindaichi were what truly made the novel shine to me. Kindaichi is very reminiscent from young Kogoro Akechi as he appears in the first short stories.
