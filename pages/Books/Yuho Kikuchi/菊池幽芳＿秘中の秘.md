summary: This is the Japanese translation by Yuho Kikuchi of the Adventure novel The Tickencote Treasure written by William Le Queux and published in 1903. In The Tickencote Treasure, a struggling doctor gets the chance of a lifetime when an old sea captain recruits him for a voyage to Africa. Unsure at first, Paul Pickering accepts his offer, embarking on a journey that brings him to the coast of Algeria. After several uneventful days at sea, the crew is surprised to discover a strange ship floating toward them. Although it resembles an old Elizabethan vessel, the hull looks relatively new. Thinking it abandoned, a group of sailors boards the phantom ship to find it hermetically sealed. Hoping for treasure, they go below deck to find a strange old man instead. As the story unfolds, an atmosphere of mystery and an ancient legend threaten to overwhelm Pickering and his comrades.
