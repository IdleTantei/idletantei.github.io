 bio: Sunao Ootsubo belongs to what Edogawa Rampo called the “戦後派五人男”, with Shigeru Kayama, Kazuo Shimada, Futaro Yamada and Akimitsu Takagi. Sunao Ootsubo only wrote short stories. His career as writer started when writer Haruo Satō suggested him to publish his short story 天狗 in a magazine. He won the Mystery Writers of Japan Award for short fiction in 1905 with the short story 私刑（リンチ), but a scandal made him fall back into poverty. His writing became scarce and he worked mainly as assistant for Renzaburo Shibata.
